This Google Cast demo application shows how to send messages from an Chrome desktop browser to a custom receiver using a custom namespace.

## Dependencies
* Chrome browser.

## Setup Instructions
* Host index.html from sender folder on your own server and open that page in your Chrome browser
* Insert your App ID in the index.html file of the sender (look for applicationID in that file)
* Upload the index.html file from receiver folder to your hosting server (so chromecast can serve that html).
